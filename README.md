# LiveWeatherDetails_WebScrapping

This project is used to demonstrate how web scraping is perfrmed in python. It brings weather data from "https://weather.com/" and then scrapes the html page to pick the crrent temperature, day and night temperature and location details. 

I have used the following libraries:
- Beatiful Soup(bs4): Used to scrape html data easily
- Requests: Used to make http requests easily
